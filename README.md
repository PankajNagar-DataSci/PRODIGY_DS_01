# World Population EDA<BR> 

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook on the world population dataset, focusing on different countries, income groups and population by region. <BR> 

## Overview<br>

The notebook `PRODIGY_DS_01.ipynb` provides an in-depth exploratory analysis of world population data, including:<Br>
- Population distribution across different countries.<br>
- Visualization of population data based on income groups.<br>
- Visualization of total population by region.<br>
- Comparison of total population and gender ratio.<br>
- Comparison of population statistics using bar charts and other visual aids. <br>

# EDA Highlights<br>
The EDA notebook covers the following key analyses:<Br>

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:<BR>

Loading the dataset and handling missing values.<Br>
Merging the datasets. <Br>
Filtering and organizing data for analysis.<Br>
Descriptive Statistics:<Br>

## Summary statistics for population data.<Br>
Distribution of population across different income groups.<Br>
Female ratio among the total population across different region. <Br>
Comparison of total population and gender ratio by region and income class. <br>


## Data Visualization:<Br>
Bar charts for visualizing population ratios in different classes (e.g., lower income, high income) for the year 2023.<Br>
creating grouped bar charts using different genders. <Br>
Comparison of population statistics between different income groups.<Br>

### Example Visualizations:<Br>
Population distribution across different countries<br>
Comparsion of total population and gender ratio<br>
Population Ratio by Income Class in 2023<Br>
